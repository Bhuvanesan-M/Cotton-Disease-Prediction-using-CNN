# Cotton-Disease-Prediction-using-CNN
Cotton-Disease-Prediction-using-CNN is a computer vision project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images of cotton plants as either healthy or diseased, and if diseased, identify the specific disease present. The goal of the project is to assist cotton farmers in quickly and accurately identifying plant diseases, allowing for timely treatment and improved crop yield.

The project involves the following steps:

Data collection: A large dataset of cotton plant images is collected, consisting of both healthy plants and plants with various diseases. The images may be obtained from public datasets or collected through on-site data collection.

Data preprocessing: The collected images are preprocessed to remove any noise or artifacts, and resized to a uniform size to ensure consistency in input images for the CNN.

Model training: A CNN model is trained on the preprocessed data to classify the images as healthy or diseased, and to identify the specific disease present if the plant is diseased. The model is trained using a labeled dataset, which includes both healthy and diseased plant images.

Model evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a test dataset to measure its performance in correctly classifying images as healthy or diseased, and identifying the specific disease present if the plant is diseased. The performance metrics used may include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to an application or platform where it can be used to classify new images of cotton plants in real-time.

Overall, the Cotton-Disease-Prediction-using-CNN project has the potential to significantly improve cotton farming practices by enabling early and accurate identification of plant diseases, leading to better crop yields and increased profits for farmers.
